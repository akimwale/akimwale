            <h5 class="text-primary mt-4">SaudiCoast Bitcoin Trust ETF ("SBTC" or "Trust")</h5>
            <p class="hike mb-4 mt-4">The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (the “Trust”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and other documents the Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the Trust and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the Trust or any authorized participant will arrange to send you the prospectus (when available) if you request it by calling (833) 903-2211 or by contacting Foreside Fund Services, LLC, Three Canal Plaza, Suite 100, Portland, Maine 04101. </p><br>
            <p class="mb-4">Foreside Fund Services, LLC is the Marketing Agent for the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF. Foreside Fund Services, LLC is not affiliated with Grayscale Securities, LLC or Grayscale Investments, LLC.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">NAV per Share is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. NAV per Share is not intended to be a substitute for the Trust's Principal Market NAV per Share calculated in accordance with GAAP.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Extreme volatility of trading prices that many digital assets, including Bitcoin, have experienced in recent periods and may continue to experience, could have a material adverse effect on the value of GBTC and the shares could lose all or substantially all of their value.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry. The value of GBTC depends on the acceptance of the digital assets, the capabilities and development of blockchain technologies and the fundamental investment characteristics of the digital asset.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Digital asset networks are developed by a diverse set of contributors and the perception that certain high-profile contributors will no longer contribute to the network could have an adverse effect on the market price of the related digital asset.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Digital assets may have concentrated ownership and large sales or distributions by holders of such digital assets could have an adverse effect on the market price of such digital assets.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The value of GBTC relates directly to the value of the underlying digital asset, the value of which may be highly volatile and subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">A substantial direct investment in digital assets may require expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the acquisition, security and safekeeping of the digital asset and may involve the payment of substantial acquisition fees from third party facilitators through cash payments of U.S. dollars. Because the value of GBTC is correlated with the value of Bitcoin, it is important to understand the investment attributes of, and the market for, the underlying digital asset. Please consult with your financial professional.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Prior to 1/11/2024, shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (the “Trust”) were offered only in private placement transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and were quoted on the OTCQX® Best Market. The Trust did not have an ongoing share creation and redemption program. Effective as of the open of business on 1/11/2024, the shares of the Trust were listed to NYSE Arca as an exchange-traded product, the Trust established an ongoing share creation and redemption program and the shares are being offered on a registered basis pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The Trust investment objective both before and after 1/11/2024 has remained constant, namely to reflect the value of Bitcoin held by the Trust, less the Trust expenses and other liabilities. However prior to 1/11/2024, the Trust did not meet its investment objective and the Trust’s shares traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, which at times were substantial, in part due to the lack of an ongoing redemption program. Furthermore, the Trust’s performance prior to 1/11/2024 is based on market-determined prices on the OTCQX, while the Trust’s performance following such date is based on market-determined prices on NYSE Arca. As a result, the Trust’s historical data prior to 1/11/2024 is not directly comparable to, and should not be used to make conclusions in conjunction with, the Trust’s performance following that date. The performance of the Trust before and after 1/11/2024 may differ significantly.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Extreme volatility of trading prices that many digital assets, including Bitcoin, have experienced in recent periods and may continue to experience, could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Product and the shares of each Product could lose all or substantially all of their value.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry.

Please consult with your financial professional.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The Product relies on third party service providers to perform certain functions essential to the affairs of the Product and the replacement of such service providers could pose a challenge to the safekeeping of the digital asset and to the operations of the Product.</p>
